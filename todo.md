lets to this solution:

To make the PowerShell script easily accessible via a single command, such as wingetup, you need to create an alias. This can be done by adding the alias to your PowerShell profile. This way, every time you open PowerShell, the alias will be available.

Open PowerShell as an Administrator.

Run the following command to open your PowerShell profile in an editor (it uses notepad, but you can use any editor of your choice):

powershell
Copy code
notepad.exe $PROFILE
If the file doesn't exist, it will ask you if you want to create it. Select "Yes".

Add the following line at the end of the file to create an alias called wingetup which points to your script. Make sure to use the full path to your script:

powershell
Copy code
Set-Alias -Name wingetup -Value "C:\full\path\to\your\script\wingetup.ps1"
Replace C:\full\path\to\your\script\wingetup.ps1 with the actual path to your script.

Save and close the file.

Close PowerShell, and then open it again (no need for admin privileges this time).

Now, you should be able to just type wingetup in PowerShell, and it will run your script. This alias will be available every time you open a new PowerShell session.

is there other ways to do it?

Certainly, there are a few other ways to achieve the same result:

Adding the script to the System Path:

a. Rename your script to wingetup.ps1 to just wingetup (without the .ps1 extension).

b. Move the script to a directory, e.g., C:\scripts.

c. Add that directory to your system's PATH environment variable. You can do this by searching for "Environment Variables" in the Windows Start Menu, then under System Variables find and edit the "Path" variable and add the directory containing your script.

d. Now you can just type wingetup in PowerShell or Command Prompt, and it will run your script.

Creating a Batch (.bat) File:

You can create a batch file that triggers your PowerShell script and place this batch file in a directory that's already in your system's PATH.

a. Create a new file with a .bat extension, e.g., wingetup.bat.

b. Add the following line to the batch file:

swift
Copy code
@powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\full\path\to\your\script\wingetup.ps1"
c. Place this batch file in a directory that's in your system's PATH, or add the directory to the PATH as described earlier.

d. Now you can just type wingetup in Command Prompt or PowerShell, and it will run your script.

Creating a PowerShell Module:

If you intend to create a suite of scripts and want them to be easily accessible, you can create a PowerShell module. This is a more advanced technique, suitable if you're developing a set of tools rather than just a single script. Here's how you'd do it:

a. Create a directory to hold your module, e.g., C:\Modules\WingetTools.

b. In this directory, create a file called WingetTools.psm1. This is the module file.

c. In WingetTools.psm1, add a function that runs your script. For example:

powershell
Copy code
function Run-WingetUp {
& 'C:\full\path\to\your\script\wingetup.ps1'
}
d. Edit your $PROFILE as before, but this time, import the module:

powershell
Copy code
Import-Module 'C:\Modules\WingetTools\WingetTools.psm1'
e. Now, whenever you open PowerShell, you can run your script by typing Run-WingetUp.

Each of these methods has its own advantages depending on your use case. The alias method is quick for a single script, adding to the PATH is useful for scripts you use often, and creating a module is powerful when you have a set of tools or functions you want to use regularly.

but i want this to be automatically added at the first run of the script.
